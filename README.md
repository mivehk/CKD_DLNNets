*<h1> Deep Learning Neural Networks for Chronic Kidney Disease Class Prediction</h1>*</br>
Python Keras & PyTorch</br>

    Kidney disease often has no symptoms until your kidneys are badly damaged. More than one in seven American adults, about 35.5 million people (14%), are estimated to have Chronic Kidney Disease (CDC, 2023), which about nine out of ten do not know about it. The underrepresented group of patients with ages equal and greater than 75 who had Atrial Fibrillation and Type-II diabetes were selected from NIH All-of-Us web portal. They were qualified for receiving oral anticoagulation medications according to the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) scoring system abbreviated CHA2DS2-VASc. We queried laboratory test results for simultaneous bivariate of the Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) as suggested by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula and Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) for the long-term plasma glucose level to investigate the association of these independent variables with the probability of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and vice versa.</br>

    The qualified CHA2DS2-VASc (F>=3, M>=2) population was split into three groups based on the date and time of CKD diagnosis reflected in All-of-Us periodical Collection Data Reports (CDR) and measurement dates. A cohort study was designed by the principle of CKD diagnosis and the exposure to eGFR and HbA1c concurrent reads to inspect retrospective measurements’ reads recorded before and after the diagnosis dates (1283 reads in 266 NoCKD patients, 564 reads in 82 preCKD patients and 987 reads in 144 CKD patients).</br>

    We decided to use two deep learning neural networks from  PyTorch and Keras(Tensorflow) libraries distributed in Python programming language for the purpose of logistic regression analysis. We instantiated the multilayer preceptor model class of torch for binary classification of CKD status based on eGFR and HbA1c as two numerical variables, but we also used indicator coding for sex at birth (Female=1, Male=0) and developed a coding system for race with a value of one for either Black, Asian or others (More than one race or unanswered) as their respective features which saved the value of zero in these three features for showing the white race.</br>  

    The combination of CKD and noCKD datasets with 2270 objects was split into 1521 records (67%) for training the network to learn weights and 749 objects (33%) for model evaluation. A fully meshed network of nodes in three layers was designed with rectified linear unit (Relu) activation function in the first two layers with “Kaiming-He” weight initialization and sigmoid activation in the output layer to generate probability predictions. The training dataset was built from epochs of shuffled 32x6 variable batches and fed into the network by clearing the gradients of the previous training epoch for each current of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimization, then forward passing the new epoch into the model to calculate loss using Binary Cross Entropy Loss (BCELoss) in comparison to actual values. The back-propagation of the calculated loss through the model for coefficient(weight) modifications reduced the loss with step sizes of 0.01 and momentum of 0.9 configured within SGD.</br>

    The tabular dataset of CKD merged with noCKD features was saved in All-of-Us secure workspace bucket, and it was redrawn for another neural network built in the Keras library. Similarly, we bisected the dataset for training the model and used sigmoid and Relu activation functions in four dense layers of nodes with Adam optimization algorithm.</br>
